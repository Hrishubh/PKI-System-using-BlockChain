<b>A distributed public key infrastructure (PKI) for the web backed by a blockchain is a security mechanism that allows for secure communication between parties on the internet. In this system, Digital Certificates are stored on a decentralized blockchain ledger, rather than in a centralized database. This ensures that the Digital Certificates are tamper-proof and cannot be altered by a single entity or compromised through a single point of failure. Additionally, blockchain technology enables the system to maintain a transparent and auditable record of all certificate management activities. This distributed PKI enhances security and privacy on the web, and provides a foundation for secure communication and transactions over the internet.</b>
