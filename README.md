**Abstract:**
A distributed public key infrastructure (PKI) for the web backed by a blockchain is a security mechanism that allows for secure communication between parties on the internet. In this system, Digital Certificates are stored on a decentralized blockchain ledger, rather than in a centralized database. This ensures that the Digital Certificates are tamper-proof and cannot be altered by a single entity or compromised through a single point of failure. Additionally, blockchain technology enables the system to maintain a transparent and auditable record of all certificate management activities. This distributed PKI enhances security and privacy on the web, and provides a foundation for secure communication and transactions over the internet.

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hrishubh/PKI-System-using-BlockChain.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd PKI-System-using-BlockChain

3. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can check if Node.js is installed by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **View the App:**
Once you run npm start, the app will be available at http://localhost:3000. Your default browser should automatically open to this address. If not, manually open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your app.
